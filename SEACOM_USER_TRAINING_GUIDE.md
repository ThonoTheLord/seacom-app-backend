## 1. Understanding What Seacom Does

**Trainer Instructions:** "Before we start learning how to use the computer system, let me explain what our company does and why your job is so important. Take notes if you need to."

### What is Telecommunications?
Telecommunications means sending information from one place to another using electronic signals. Think of it like this:
- When you make a phone call, you're using telecommunications
- When you watch TV, you're using telecommunications
- When you use the internet, you're using telecommunications

Our company, Seacom, owns and operates a large network of equipment that makes all of this communication possible. We have:
- **Towers and antennas** that send and receive signals (like giant metal structures you see on hills)
- **Cables underground** that connect different parts of our network
- **Buildings full of equipment** that process and route all the communication signals
- **Power systems** that keep everything running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

### What is Network Operations?
Network operations means making sure all of our telecommunications equipment is working properly. Imagine our network is like a huge highway system:
- Cars (information) need to travel from city to city (people's homes and businesses)
- The highways need to be clear and well-maintained
- If there's a pothole or accident, traffic gets slowed down
- Someone needs to watch the highways and fix problems quickly

That's what you do! You watch our "highways" (the network) and make sure information can flow smoothly.

### Why Do We Need This Computer System?
Without our computer system, we would have to:
- Use paper notebooks to track what work needs to be done
- Make phone calls back and forth to coordinate
- Drive around to check on equipment in person
- Hope that problems get reported correctly

With Seacom, everything is organized in one place:
- All work assignments are listed clearly
- Everyone can see what everyone else is doing
- Problems are reported instantly
- We can predict when equipment might fail before it happens

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs) - What This Means
Some of our customers pay extra for guaranteed service levels. This means:
- If they have an internet outage, we promise to fix it within 4 hours
- If their phone service goes down, we guarantee it will be back within 2 hours
- If we break these promises, we have to pay them money as a penalty

Your job includes making sure we meet these promises. If we're about to break a promise, the system will warn you so you can fix it in time.

## 2. Getting Started - Your First Login

**Trainer Instructions:** "Now we're going to learn how to start using the computer system. I'll show you each step on the big screen, and then you'll practice it yourself. Go slowly - there's no rush."

### Step 1: Opening Your Web Browser
A web browser is the program you use to look at websites on the internet.

**Trainer Instructions:** "Look at your computer screen. See the icons on your desktop? Find the one that looks like a globe or has the word 'Chrome' or 'Edge' or 'Firefox'. That's your web browser. Double-click it slowly."

- If you see Google Chrome (looks like a colorful circle), click that
- If you see Microsoft Edge (looks like a blue 'e'), click that
- If you see Firefox (looks like a fox wrapped around a globe), click that

**What to do if you can't find it:**
- Click the Windows button (looks like a window) in the bottom left
- Type "chrome" or "edge" or "firefox" and press Enter

### Step 2: Going to the Seacom Website
Once your browser opens, you need to type in the address of our system.

**Trainer Instructions:** "See the bar at the top of the browser that has 'https://' in it? That's called the address bar. Click in that bar and type this address exactly: [insert your company website address here]. Press Enter on your keyboard."

The address bar is usually at the top of the screen. It might say something like "Search Google or type a URL" - that's where you type website addresses.

### Step 3: Entering Your Login Information
You'll see a login screen with boxes to fill in.

**Trainer Instructions:** "Look for the box that says 'Username' or 'Email'. Click in that box and type your username exactly as it was given to you. Don't add extra spaces."

- **Username:** This is usually your email address or a special code given to you by IT
- **Password:** This is the secret code you were told to create or were given

**Important Rules for Passwords:**
- Never share your password with anyone
- Don't write it down where others can see it
- If you forget it, ask IT for help - don't try to guess
- Change it every 90 days when the system asks you to

**Trainer Instructions:** "Now click in the password box. Type your password carefully. Notice that dots or asterisks appear instead of letters - that's to keep it secret."

### Step 4: Selecting Your Job Role
After typing username and password, you might see buttons to choose your role.

**Trainer Instructions:** "Look at the buttons on the screen. Click the one that matches your job title. If you're not sure, ask your supervisor."

- **NOC Operator** - if you watch monitors and coordinate work
- **Technician** - if you go out to fix equipment
- **Manager** - if you supervise other people
- **Administrator** - if you set up the system (usually IT people)

### Step 5: First Time Setup
The first time you log in, the system might ask for more information.

**Trainer Instructions:** "The system wants to know more about you. Fill in each box carefully."

- **Full Name:** Type your complete name as it appears on your ID
- **Phone Number:** Your work phone number
- **Emergency Contact:** Someone to call if there's an emergency
- **Location:** Where you usually work from

### Step 6: Setting Up Notifications
The system can send you alerts in different ways.

**Trainer Instructions:** "These are like alarms that tell you when something needs attention. Choose how you want to be notified."

- **Email alerts:** Messages sent to your email inbox
- **Phone notifications:** Text messages to your phone
- **Screen pop-ups:** Messages that appear on your computer screen
- **Sound alerts:** Beeps or chimes from your computer

**Trainer Instructions:** "For most jobs, choose 'Screen pop-ups' and 'Email alerts'. Technicians should also choose 'Phone notifications'."

### Step 7: Setting Up Location Tracking (For Technicians)
If you're a field technician, the system needs to know where you are.

**Trainer Instructions:** "If you go out to fix equipment, the system needs to know your location. Click 'Allow' when it asks for location permission."

- Click "Allow" when the browser asks for location access
- Make sure your phone GPS is turned on if you have a company phone
- The system will show your location on a map so others know where you are

### Step 8: Customizing Your Screen Layout
You can arrange the screen to fit how you work.

**Trainer Instructions:** "You can move things around on your screen to make it easier for you. Try dragging the boxes to different positions."

- **Drag and drop:** Click and hold, then move items around
- **Resize boxes:** Drag the corners to make boxes bigger or smaller
- **Hide/show sections:** Click the minus or plus buttons to show/hide parts
